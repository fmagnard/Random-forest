# Random-forest

I implemented a random forest classifier in Python. The performance of the classifier is evaluated using 10fold cross validation on a provided dataset.<br/>

To train the classifier, I worked on the wine dataset, which is often used for evaluating classification algorithms. The classification task is to determine whether the quality of a particular wine
is over 7. The wine quality scores is mapped to binary classes of 0 and 1. Wine scores
from 0 to 6 (inclusive) are mapped to 0, wine scores of 7 and above are mapped to 1. I perform binary classification on the dataset. The dataset is extracted from
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality. The data is stored in a comma separated file
(csv). Each line describes a wine using 12 columns: the first 11 describe the wineâ€™s characteristics, and the last column is a ground t ruth label for the
quality of the wine (0/1).
